# Architecture
The app is made up of three parts:
* **The client** application is a javascript/react application that runs in the browser on users' machines. 
It is served by the app server and communicates with it through REST endpoints. The client directory contains all of the client code and can be built as an independent bundle. For more on specific client architecture and technical details see: [Client architecture](/client/contributing.md)
* Server
* Database
