# Architecture

The FLOM app is made up of three parts:
* **The client** application is a javascript/react application that runs in the browser on users' machines. 
It is served by the app server and communicates with it through REST endpoints. The client directory contains all of the client code and can be built as an independent bundle. For more on specific client architecture and technical details see: [Client architecture](client.md)
* **The server** is an express application that runs on **nodejs**. It serves the client application bundle and exposes a number of REST endpoints. It also communicates with the database using **sequelize**, a library that assists with database connections in node. All communication with the database is done through rest endpoints on the server. For more on server architecture, see: [Server architecture](/docs/server.md)
* **The database** setup is a **Postgres** system that includes migrations and an ORM that the server app uses to connect to it. Postrgres can be set up wherever and however desired and the server app includes facilities to initiate the flom database and migrations to bootstrap it into the required schema. Though any Postgres server can be used, the flom app Docker setup installs and bootstraps a pre-configured Postgres server that runs in the same Docker container as the server. For more see [Database setup](/docs/database.md)
